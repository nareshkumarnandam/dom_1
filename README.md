# Styling a Div with Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to dynamically style a div using the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript. By manipulating the DOM, we can apply various styles to a div element, creating a dynamic and interactive user interface.

## Getting Started

To view the hosted version of the project, follow these simple steps:

### Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/nareshkumarnandam/dom_1.git

### Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd dom_1

### Open index.html in a Web Browser:

Double-click on the index.html file, or
Open it using your preferred web browser.

## Interact with the Styled Div:

Once the page loads, you'll see a div element styled using JavaScript.
Hover over the div to see dynamic styling effects.
Project Structure
-**index.html:** The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
-**script.js:** JavaScript file containing the logic for dynamically styling the div using the DOM.

## How it Works

The JavaScript code in script.js selects the div element from the DOM and applies different styles dynamically. The styles change when you hover over the div, providing a simple demonstration of DOM manipulation for styling.

## Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different styling options!
